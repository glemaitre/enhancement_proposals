SLEP011: Governance Change
==========================

Abstract
########

This SLEP proposes a change in the decision making process. It proposes to not
always call for a TC vote in case that no consensus is found during the vote of
a SLEP. Instead, the matter goes to the TC if the proposer appeals to the TC.

Motivation
##########

Currently, the decision making process included in the governance document
includes the following statement:

"[...] If no option can gather two thirds of the votes cast, the decision is
escalated to the TC, which in turn will use consensus seeking with the fallback
option of a simple majority vote if no consensus can be found within a month.
[...]"

It might not be necessary to call for a TC vote if the proposer want to review
the SLEP and make a new proposal.

Solution
########

"[...] If no option can gather two thirds of the votes cast, the decision is
escalated to the TC **if the SLEP proposer would like the SLEP to be accepted**, which in turn will
use consensus seeking with the fallback option of a simple majority vote if no
consensus can be found within a month. [...]"

Considerations
